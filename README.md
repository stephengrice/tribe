# tribe

A fun little Javascript game. Spawn little dots and keep them fed!

I wrote this as a fun project a while ago. Just getting around to documenting it now.

## Controls

Press a control to enter that "mode." Each mode is summarized below.

**Spawn**: Press this button and start clicking in different places on the screen. Your tribe will start to spawn!

**Select**: Click and drag to select your tribe members.

**Command**: Click anywhere on the screen, and any selected tribe members will start to go to that point.

**Buy food**: Click anywhere on the screen to place food, which any idle tribe members will run over to and eat.
